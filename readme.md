#Summary
This project is resposible to sync customer data from basic auth token based CRM using the endpoint exposed by the client CRM. 
This waits for an API call to land on its exposed endpoint and use the account number provided in that to hit the client API which in response gives json data 
Then next step would be to connect to mysql db and insert that data into the db for other services to use that data for AI input learning data
